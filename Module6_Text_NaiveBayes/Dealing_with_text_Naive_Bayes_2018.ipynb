The rows here are records in the original data and the columns are words. Given the shape, this means there are ~140m cells that should have values.

    "### Modeling with another technique: Naive Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have been exposed to tree classifiers and logistic regression in class. We have also seen SVM model in the homework. Now, it's time for another popular modeling technique of supervised learning(especially in text classification): the Naive Bayes (NB) classifier. In particular, we are using a Bernoulli Naive Bayes (BNB) for our binary classification. (Bernoulli NB is the model described in the book; there are other versions of NB, see below.)\n",
    "\n",
    "As described in your text, the Naive Bayes model is a **probabilistic approach which assumes conditional independence between features** (in this case, each word is a feature, the conditioning is on the true class). It assigns class labels (e.g. spam = 1 or spam = 0). In other words, Naive Bayes models the probabilities of the presence of each _word_, given that we have a spam email, and given that we have a non-spam email.  Then it combines them using Bayes Theorem (again, as described in the book).\n",

    "Also, there are other versions of naive Bayes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Multinomial naive Bayes (MNB):** This model handles count features and not just binary features. Sometimes MNB is used with binary presence/absence variables anyway (like word presence), even though that violates the model assumptions, because in practice it works well anyway.\n",
