    "Regular expressions (regexes or reâ€™s) constitute an extremely powerful, flexible and concise language for matching elements in text ranging from a few characters to complex patterns. While mastering the syntax of the regular expression language does require climbing a learning curve, this learning curve is not particularly steep, and a newcomer can find herself performing useful tasks with regular expressions almost immediately. Efforts spent learning regular expressions quickly pay off--tasks that are well suited for regular expressions abound. Indeed, regular expressions are one of the most useful computer skills, and an absolutely critical tool for data scientists. "

    "### Additional Regular Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "While we have not used these before, they are commonly used shortcuts to simplify the construction of regular expressions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `\\d`: matches the digits, 0-9.\n",
    "* `\\D`: matches anything but `\\d`.\n",
    "* `\\w`: matches any alphanumeric character plus underscore: `[A-Za-z0-9_]`.\n",
    "* `\\W`: matches anything but `\\w`.\n",
    "* `\\s`: matches any \"whitespace\" character (space, tab, newline, etc): `[ \\t\\n\\r\\f\\v]`.\n",
    "* `\\S`: matches anything but `\\s`.\n",
    "* `\\b`: matches the breaks between alphanumeric and non-alphanumeric characters (an empty string), the boundary between `\\w` and `\\W`. Useful for ensuring that what you match is actually a word.\n",
    "* `\\B`: matches anything but `\\b`. Useful for ensuring your match is in the middle of a word.\n",
    "\n",
    "And the ones below get a little bit more advanced:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `*?`, `+?`: ordinarily, `*`, `+` and `?` are greedy, matching the longest possible string that satisfies the regular expression. Adding the `?` to any of these makes it non-greedy, instead matching the shortest possible expression. \n",
    "* `(?: )`: A non-capturing group. This works just as `()`, but doesnâ€™t hold on to the matched contents.\n",
    "* `(?<=x)`: Matches any string that is preceded by x (an arbitrary regular expression).\n"
